# RoboFriends

This is my first web app, created with React.js. I will be adding things to it as I continue to learn

### What the app does / has (for now)
* A functional database (postgreSQL) for fetching users on sign in and storing user information
* Updates the user list based on what's typed in the search bar
* Assigns a random robot picture to a user by their "id" from [robo hash](https://robohash.org/)

### Features i want to add (rather, features that are possible for me to add at the moment)
* A mobile view
* Last seen
* Date Joined (this is already on the db though)
* name and logo of the app on the website's tab

### What is wrong with it?
I mean it runs fine but... 
* When someone signs up, the login details are sent to the database but the frontend doesn't refresh and show the user's card.
* It exposes all my users in the network monitor tab.
